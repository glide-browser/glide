# Chat

An official real-time discussion channel is hosted on the [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/) IRC network in the `#glide` channel. At the time of writing it is very inactive, pinging `@probablyrobert` should increase the chance of your message getting a response.

If you're not familiar with IRC, the Libera.Chat [basics](https://libera.chat/guides/basics) document is a good starting point.

If you're familiar with IRC, join [#glide](ircs://irc.libera.chat/glide) on `path:irc.libera.chat`.

## Discussions

For asynchronous, or lengthier more involved discussions, you should use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/glide-browser/glide/discussions) instead.
