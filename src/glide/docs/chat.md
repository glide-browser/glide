An official real-time discussion channel is available to members and guests of the site, hosted on the Libera.Chat IRC network in #lobsters. This channel was originally created by kristof on freenode, and stayed with the network on 2021-05-19 after that domain was lost. The channel operators are (IRC nicks in parentheses): pushcx (pushcx), Irene (Irenes), 355e3b (c355e3b), aleph (Church), c-cube (companion_cube), and eBPF (d76d5).

If you're new to IRC, bear in mind that the channel may appear empty; you won't see any messages that were sent before you joined or whilst you were away. The channel is most active during US work hours and there are usually 100â€“1000 messages a day. If you leave the channel open you'll probably catch a discussion. The channel isn't busy enough that there's always someone talking, so don't be surprised if you try to start a conversation and no one responds. The easiest way to join is with the official Libera web chat.

If you're familiar with IRC, join #lobsters on irc.libera.chat.

The policies and ideals of the discussion channel are the same as the website; quality content and conversing, respect for other users, and no spamming. Slightly off-topic discussion is generally acceptable, but we're still not open to discussion of electoral politics and policies.

If you want an invite to the site, it's best to hang out and chat until people get to know you. They'll likely ask you for a link to your homepage or a public profile to feel confident that you're not a spammer. If you ask for an invite immediately on joining, expect people will be a lot more skeptical.

If you are the author of or otherwise involved with a story that was submitted to the site, ask and someone can send you an invite. We've unfortunately had problems with impersonation, so it helps a lot if you point out how your email address is linked to the story.

The channel has a bot named mockturtle. It announces new stories submitted to the site and provides other useful features like showing the page title of URLs mentioned in the channel.

If you'd like a cloak to note that you've contributed to Lobsters development or just for privacy as a regular user, contact a channel operator for a lobsters/developer/username or lobsters/user/username cloak.

For a feed of stories without discussion, mockturtle also posts new stories in #lobsters-feed.

If you are interested in working on the Lobsters codebase or using it to run your own site, as of February 2025 we have a Zulip-based chat room. If you run a sister site please ask to be added to the `#security-notifications` stream for any vulnerability announcements. This is also an experiment to evaluate whether we should move the primary Lobsters chat room over to Zulip.

Lobsters used to have a channel called #lobsters-boil for off-topic conversations (especially American politics) that "boiled over" from the main channel. It was useful in the wake of some big events, but the mods didn't want to run it indefinitely. Community members independently run ##crustaceans subject to their own policies, if you're looking for more off-topic discussion.
