# Chat

The primary real-time discussion channel is a [Zulip](https://zulip.com) organisation, hosted at [glide.zulipchat.com](https://glide.zulipchat.com).

## IRC

An official [#glide](ircs://irc.libera.chat/glide) channel is also hosted on the [Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat/) IRC network.

## Discussions

For asynchronous, or lengthier more involved discussions, you should use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/glide-browser/glide/discussions) instead.
