# Plugins

Glide supports a basic version of plugins by defining directories that can contain additional `glide.ts` files that will be loaded after your config.

For example, defining a file at `~/.config/glide/plugins/github/glide.ts`, will result in Glide loading it, just like it was part of your own config.
