# Privacy

Generally, Glide has the same privacy considerations as Firefox, with [Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) included by default.

It is an explicit non-goal to go as far as other privacy focused forks such as [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/). We aim to provide as much privacy as possible without causing breakage, which means features like [resist fingerprinting](https://librewolf.net/docs/faq/#what-are-the-most-common-downsides-of-rfp-resist-fingerprinting) will not be configured at the strongest level by default.
